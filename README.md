# cf-byline
WordPress plugin for displaying custom bylines from a post's custom-byline custom field.
Converted from an old (and frequently-used) custom theme function... here turned into a simple, standalone plugin for seamlessness.

usage: add (or select existing) `custom-byline` custom field in a post or page to display the value in place of the author.
